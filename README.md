# Introduction to ToyLang

ToyLang is a simple scripting language implemented in Go, designed to help learn basic programming language concepts such as lexical analysis, syntax parsing, and code evaluation.

## Feature Overview
- **Lexer**: Responsible for breaking the source code into tokens.
- **Parser**: Builds an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to represent the code structure.
- **Evaluator**: Executes the code and handles variables, functions, and control flow.

## How to Use
1. Ensure you have Go environment installed.
2. Run `go build` to compile the project.
